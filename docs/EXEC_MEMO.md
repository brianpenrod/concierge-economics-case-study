# Executive Memo — Concierge Economics (Synthetic Case Study)

**To:** Senior Leadership  
**From:** Brian Penrod, DBA  
**Date:** February 25, 2026  
**Subject:** Concierge Economics — Margin Drivers, Scenarios, and Recommendation

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
**Recommendation:** Close the Capital One Concierge margin gap vs. Velocity Black by (1) lifting revenue per request through partner/pricing levers and (2) tightening fulfillment unit costs, while prioritizing Travel SLA improvements to protect customer outcomes.  
**Why now:** Travel is the highest-margin request type but the lowest SLA area; economics and experience are currently moving in opposite directions, creating risk unless we monitor and intervene early.

## What we learned (economics in plain English)
1) **Primary margin drivers:** revenue per request (pricing/partner terms), request mix (Travel/Events vs. lower-value categories), and fulfillment unit cost per request.  
2) **Customer outcome impact:** SLA is the leading indicator for experience. Travel runs the lowest SLA and is most likely to drive dissatisfaction/churn if not controlled.  
3) **Key risk:** optimizing for margin by pushing mix toward Travel can degrade SLA and retention if capacity and partner execution don’t keep up.  
4) **Leading indicators to monitor:** contribution margin %, revenue/request, variable cost/request, Travel SLA, retention, and requests/member.

## Current snapshot (180-day synthetic sample)
- **Velocity Black CM%:** ~44% vs **Capital One Concierge CM%:** ~38% (gap ~6 pp)
- **Revenue/request:** $15.71 (VB) vs $13.53 (C1)
- **Variable cost/request:** $7.85 (VB) vs $7.53 (C1)
- **Overall SLA:** ~91.8%; **Travel SLA:** ~89.2% (lowest)

## Scenarios (12 months, with fixed cost per member)
- **Base case:** ~37% operating margin; moderate growth with stable unit costs and retention.
- **Upside case:** ~42% operating margin; improved growth + retention + utilization, with modest unit-cost improvement.
- **Downside case:** ~29% operating margin; higher churn + cost pressure + weaker utilization.

## Options & tradeoffs
### Option A — Revenue per Request Lift (Partner + Pricing Levers)
- Expected impact: Improve CM% by lifting revenue/request (commission, partner terms, tier packaging).
- Cost/complexity: Medium (requires partner negotiations / pricing governance).
- Risks: Customer backlash if value isn’t clear; needs strong monitoring.

### Option B — Fulfillment Unit Cost Reset (Cost per Request)
- Expected impact: Reduce variable cost/request via workflow, routing, partner optimization.
- Cost/complexity: Medium–High (process + vendor ops).
- Risks: Cost cuts can hurt SLA if executed bluntly.

### Option C — Travel SLA Stabilization (Experience Protection)
- Expected impact: Raise Travel SLA above threshold while maintaining margin; protects retention/LTV.
- Cost/complexity: Medium (capacity planning + partner escalation).
- Risks: May require short-term cost increase; must validate ROI.

## Decision requested
Approve a 30/60/90 plan:
- **30 days:** Launch weekly economics scorecard + alerts; segment by product/tier/channel and request type.
- **60 days:** Pilot Option A + Option C on Travel and Premium tiers; measure uplift and SLA impact.
- **90 days:** Scale the winning levers; formalize governance cadence and thresholds.
